# Cozy Game Corner: Relax & Play - An AI Generated Astro Site

This Astro site was generated by an AI assistant.

## Theme
Discover and share your favorite cozy game recommendations! Join a community of gamers seeking relaxing and heartwarming experiences.

## Setup & Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or yarn install, or pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser at `http://localhost:4321`.

3.  **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The static files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Images
The articles currently use placeholder images from `https://placehold.co`. You should replace these with actual images.
The frontmatter of each article in `src/content/blog/` contains an `image` field:
```yaml
image:
  url: 'path/to/your/image.jpg' # Update this
  alt: 'Descriptive alt text'   # Update this
```
Place your images in the `public/images/` directory and update the `url` to be like `/images/your-image.jpg`.

## Cloudflare Compatibility
This site is configured for static output by default (`output: 'static'` in `astro.config.mjs`), making it ready for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.
If SSR with Cloudflare was requested and the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter is included, follow Cloudflare's instructions for deploying Astro SSR sites.

## Customization
- Explore `src/pages/` for page structure.
- Modify layouts in `src/layouts/`.
- Add or edit components in `src/components/`.
- Blog posts are in `src/content/blog/`.
- Site configuration is in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Dependencies are in `package.json`.
- Add global styles in `src/styles/global.css` and import it in `BaseLayout.astro`.

Happy coding!
